# Getting Started (8th May'19)

Before going for the project, I am going to read about CNN. 

This repo will contain all the notes and codes I will code for learning CNN.

## Convolution Neural Networks

Convolutional networks are simply neural networks that use convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. 

### Motivation for Computer Vision:

1. Sparse Interaction.
2. Parameter Sharing.
3. Equivariant Representations.
